# Analizator podataka (Data grapher)

This is my highschool graduation work, it's a basic 
Visual C# and Python program that creates 4 types of graphs (bar, line, scatter and pie graphs).

I used Visual C# for the GUI of the program, which makes calls for Python programs which create the different plots.
The Python programs use Pandas to read the datasets and Seaborn/Mathplotlib to create the graphs.

## Contents
